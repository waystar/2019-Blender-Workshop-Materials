Click green "Code" button to select option for downloading as a ZIP file.

This workshop is for Blender 2.80 and is the same as the Blender 2.79 workshop from 2017. 

The interface has changed considerably, but the largest change is how layers are set up and used for asset management and separating layers for rendering different effects.

If you need to use version 2.79 or earlier, use the 2017 workshop materials.

For versions 2.9x - 3.xx , the 2019 workshop materials still apply. Many new features have been added since 2.8, but the interface is similar enough.
